## Preface

First of all, I don't hate FOSS (if that were the case I wouldn't have released my code on GitHub), but there are people (like [this mob](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV/issues/7)) who irritate me beyond end. These people (Whom I will call FOSSbros) are easily the worst, they're worse than RIIRers (I really mean it), and good god I'm so glad my dumb young-self didn't become one of them (well, I almost became them at one point).

### [Free as in toilet](http://unhandledexpression.com/general/2018/11/27/foss-is-free-as-in-toilet.html)

Software needs maintenance, and it just so happens that managing a large FOSS project can get really really ugly. From "clean coders", RIIR people, and worst of all (like the mob I linked earlier) Stallmanists. Stallmanists are a subset of FOSSbros who want all code to be under the GPLv3 license ([and of course they make a fool out of themselves](https://news.slashdot.org/story/20/01/24/2211238/free-software-foundation-suggests-microsoft-upcycle-windows-7-as-open-source)). So not only do FOSS maintainers have to deal with all of that (and more), they have to also do their job as programmers (well, FOSS maintainers aren't always programmers from what I've seen, but most of them, anyway) and spend time maintaining, updating, adding new features, while getting almost nothing in return (unless if they have a patreon or OpenCollective). A Fortune 500 company starred your repo?, well too bad, you're not getting everything more than that.

This is why people are afraid of releasing their code as FOSS, I don't blame them either, Closed source maintenance seems to be saner than the FOSS circus (at least in my experience and the people I talked to's experiences).

### Fuck you, pay me

About Fortune 500 companies not paying for that software, that has been the trump card of anti-FOSS people for a while now. Sadly it is a real thing, Fortune 500 companies use people's FOSSware for completely free while not giving back a single nickel or contribution. some Stallmanists may now think that the solution is GPLv3, but I'm going to discuss why it isn't.

### Stallmanists

I discussed Stallmanists a bit in a previous section. But I want to talk about them a bit more. I believe that they are the worst people in the god damn software world. and they are everywhere preaching companies to release their code as GPLv3. People who say that

> Companyies awe the wowst entities in the wowwd, they'we puwe eviw and we shouwd make ouw wicense to powew the peopwe and make companyies go bankwupt

are delusional, although I still don't like the idea of multi-national companies using FOSS to spy on people, they're not as bad as say Chinese Black Hats who have a track record of straight up ignoring copy-left licenses.

I don't even think most copyleft licenses are that good, but I'll refrain from that here.

### FOSS "Magic"

Some people often rave about how FOSS is just magic, how it just works, how the "evil" closed source is harder to use and shit, the thing is though, the open/closeness of the software _doesn't matter_. GIMP is significantly worse than Photoshop in my and several designer's experience, the thing that makes software in general seems magical is how the code is well, programmed. there's little to no corelation of FOSS software being better just because it's open source, Blender took ages for it to be good.

Point is, it doesn't matter if it's closed or open, I use what works, and so should you.

### Stop the Source Begging

Seriously, just stop. I don't even know how to write this down, begging for people's source code that they worked hard on is just petty. I have no problem if they release the code after a beg, but if you do it _multiple_ times, it gets annoying and they probably don't want to open it even more. Case in point CEMU until recently had been a closed-source project.
